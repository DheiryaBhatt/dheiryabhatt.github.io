(sometimes you will find this techy and command prompt lines, because after all i am a coder.)

Welcome to my digital space! After months of planning (and some procrastination), I finally decided to create a proper online presence. 

Truth to be told, ("Air Quotes") : In the year 2025, I had build up so much of life learnings that was either by making my self fall into the ground or even Patiently waiting for me to answer my own questions. 

Sometimes, I think that Some of my personal life lessons are not meant to be repeated. But to learn from them and share my stories. (I don't want my stories to be buried down when I am not here anymore.) 

I will start to treat this blog, as my own digital diary. Cause, What I share is not my own story to share, it is meant to for you to live by myside.

Don't worry, there is no emotional context behind this. Just simple one friend to another friend who is narating the story and you are reading this.

**What you can expect from this?** 
Simple Truthful stories. That's my promise.
