**Well usually, like every year**, I sit down to write something for my birthday. This year it is the same thing, but on website as well.  A whole year passed—not just a number is added to my age. But new experience, new learnings, self reflection, good and bad moments…. A lot has happened this year. 


**Turning 24 feels different.** This was the year that I realised that I’m not a careless adult anymore—I’m someone trying to understand life one mistake at a time.


**When I turned 23**, I moved to Studentendorf, surrounded by a whole floor of people who somehow became friends overnight. We hung out constantly, laughed too much, cooked together, survived deadlines together—I learned what friendship actually feels like. But even then, I was scared of social situations. I always hesitated when it came to making friends or enjoying life freely. I wished I could stay consistent with work, studies, reading, walking… all the small routines that make life feel balanced.



**One of the biggest twists this year** was leaving Marburg (_my certified Hell-Hole™_) and moving to Paderborn. New uni, new city, new chapter—_**Keine Vergangenheit**_. 
P.S: Let’s just say Marburg gave me enough drama for two chapters: random things people said to my face, communication that fell apart like Jenga blocks, and decisions I still overthink. But those chapters are closed now—archived, sealed, and not for re-reading


**This year surprised me more than I expected**. I learned that I’m an oversharer. I ghost people when the vibe feels wrong. I realised communication is something I need to handle more gently. _Some lessons came harshly_—learning to slow down, speak softer, listen better. Others came softly—understanding that life removes things you don’t need, even when it hurts or feels unfair in the moment.


**I realised I speak fast, feel fast, move fast**—**and that speed makes me inconsistent.** I give too much of myself even when I don’t have the energy for it. I jump into conversations with intensity and then lose interest just as quickly. Accepting this was painful, but it made me understand myself better.


**I discovered a strange strength in myself**—I can be soft when it matters, and firm when I need to protect my peace. But I also faced my weaknesses: social anxiety, poor time management, and my lifelong war with finishing books.


**24 carries its own hopes.** Adventures, new opportunities, new friends, new travels, a finished master’s degree, and a few surprises along the way. I want to stay kind-hearted, calm, non-toxic—just with better boundaries, quieter reactions, and more respect for my own energy.


**And of course, thank you** to the people who held me together this year: Mummy, Papa, Hitarth, Bhabhi, Bauerbach Buddies, Echo Chamber, Etage-1 Jung Stilling Haus, Mayur, Manan . _You made the hard days lighter than you know._


I would like to end this blog with last line “_**This year I let go of the people who disturbed my peace. Not because I disliked them, but because I finally understood that peace is a responsibility, not a luxury.**_”


I also learned to say goodbye in many languages this year:


Aavjo, Tschö,  Adíos, Ciao, Güle Güle, До свидания, ნახვამდის.


Best Regards / M.F.G,
