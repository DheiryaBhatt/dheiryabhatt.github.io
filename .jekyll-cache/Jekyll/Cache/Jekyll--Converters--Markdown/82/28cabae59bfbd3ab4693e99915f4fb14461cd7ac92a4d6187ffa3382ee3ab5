<p>Welcome to my digital space! After months of planning (and some procrastination), I finally decided to create a proper online presence. This blog represents my commitment to sharing knowledge, documenting my learning journey, and connecting with the developer community.</p>

<h2 id="-cat-motivationtxt">$ cat motivation.txt</h2>

<p>Starting this blog while being a student at <strong>Universit√§t Paderborn</strong> and working at <strong>dSPACE GmbH</strong> feels like the perfect time to document my experiences. Here‚Äôs why:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learn in Public</strong>: Teaching others helps solidify my own understanding</li>
  <li><strong>Document Progress</strong>: Track my growth as a developer and student</li>
  <li><strong>Build Community</strong>: Connect with fellow students and developers</li>
  <li><strong>Share Experiences</strong>: Help others navigating similar paths</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose the console theme because it reflects my love for the terminal and clean, minimalist design. There‚Äôs something beautiful about the simplicity of a command line interface.</p>

<p>Moving from India to study in Germany has been an incredible journey. The education system, work culture at dSPACE, and the tech community here have all contributed to my growth.</p>
