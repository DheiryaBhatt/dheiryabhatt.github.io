<h3 id="before-arriving">Before Arriving</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Learn basic German</strong> - even basics help immensely</li>
  <li><strong>Research housing early</strong> - student accommodation fills up fast</li>
  <li><strong>Understand the bureaucracy</strong> - lots of paperwork, but it‚Äôs manageable</li>
  <li><strong>Budget properly</strong> - factor in all living costs</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="after-arrival">After Arrival</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Get your documents sorted ASAP</strong> - residence permit, bank account, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Join student organizations</strong> - great way to make friends</li>
  <li><strong>Explore student job opportunities</strong> - financial and professional benefits</li>

<p>Paderborn might be smaller than Berlin or Munich, but it has a solid tech community, especially around the university and companies like dSPACE.</p>

<h2 id="balancing-work-and-studies">Balancing Work and Studies</h2>

<p>Working while studying requires good time management:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use university tools</strong>: Calendar apps, task management systems</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with employers</strong>: Be clear about exam periods and study needs</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize ruthlessly</strong>: Not everything needs to be perfect</li>
  <li><strong>Take breaks</strong>: Burnout is real, especially when adapting to a new country</li>
</ul>
